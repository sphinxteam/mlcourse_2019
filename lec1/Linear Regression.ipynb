    "# Making Predictions: Linear Regression \n",
    "\n",
    "Classification isn't the only task within the scope of supervised machine learning. **Regression** is another equally important task with many complementary features. In regression, we are asked to make a real-valued prediction based upon a dataset of samples. As in classification, we can think of our dataset as an $N\\times P$ matrix, with $N$ samples and $P$ features. However, for supervised tasks, instead of binary/multi-valued *labels* corresponding to partitions of the dataset, we are, often, interested in matching real-valued *response* variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of simple linear regression, the problems we look at are of the form\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{w} + \\mathbf{\\xi},$$\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{y}$ are our response variables, the matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ is our dataset, the vector $\\mathbf{\\xi}$ represents some noise or uncertainty on our model, and we hope to find the *explanatory* variables $\\mathbf{w}$ which are able to match our observations and which generalize to future observations. Additionally, one can generalize to a wide class of so-called generalized linear models via\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{y} = {\\rm f}(\\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{w}),$$\n",

    "$${\\rm arg~min}_{\\mathbf{w}} \\quad -\\log P(\\mathbf{y}|\\mathbf{X}, \\mathbf{w}) - \\log P(\\mathbf{w}).$$ \n",
    "If we return to our first definition of linear regression, with additive noise that is assumed to be *iid* Gaussian, and assuming a uniform prior on the value of $\\mathbf{w}$, we arrive at the common least squares (LSQ) problem,\n",
    "$${\\rm arg~min}_{\\mathbf{w}} \\quad ||\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{w} ||_2^2,$$\n",
    "which we can interpret as a **maximum likelihood (ML)** solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regressions, and specifically linear regressions, often form the basis of the ___\"Do The Simplest Thing That Could Possibly Work.\"___ Many times in production, simple regressions provide good-enough performance which maximize the tradeoff against engineering costs (coding time, computer time). And, as we will later see, regressions can even be applied to solve classification tasks, as in *logistic* regression. So, truly, regressions should be the first step when encountering a new data-science or ML problem. Things can only, hopefully, go up from here!"

However, in practice, we often don't know how simple or complex the underlying data is. There are a couple of approaches here. One is to simply acquire more data, and make sure that you acquire data over the whole range of possible values. But, scaling up data acquisition might not be feasible for some applications. How can we tune the parameters that we use? Lets take a look at **regularization**. \n",

    "In the examples we have looked at, we had a simple univariate problem and we were interested in making regressions according to functions (polynomials) of that cure datum. In this case, we have some discretion in choosing how complicated of a model to pick. And we have a natural way to scale the generalization capability of the model.\n",

We would like to estabilish some model of the result given some combination of these measured features. \n",

Our idea is simply to acquire as much data as we can and write an algorithm to find the correlations in the dataset. In this case, we need to have some method of *selecting* the best possible features. Additionally, we are often taking measurements of different features which might be highly correlated, thus reducing the overall predictiveness of our regression model (with respect to the number of measured features).\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization offers us a possiblity of accounting for some of these obstacles. We want to admit as complicated of a model as possible (to drive down fitting error), but we want some degree of regularization in order to also promote the *simplest* model as possible. Lets take a look at a few approaches.\n",

    "### Ridge Regression\n",

    "In this regression, the regularization term $\\lambda$ serves as a tuning term which balances between the model fit and the variance of the model parameters. Because this regularization penalizes \"long\" parameter vectors via the $\\ell_2$ norm, this kind of regression is often referred to as a **shrinkage**. \n",
